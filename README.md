# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction
This project focuses on predicting Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using SHAP for interpretability and multiple machine learning algorithms: SVM, KNN, RF, and GRU. The GRU model achieved the highest accuracy of 97%. A user-friendly interface was designed using Streamlit to facilitate easy interaction and visualization of predictions.
